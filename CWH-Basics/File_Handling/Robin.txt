Time slips through our hand like grains of sand. never to
return again. Those who use time wisely from an early age are
rewarded with rich. productive and satisfyig lives.

                               -The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari.


Most people live-Whether physically,intellectually
or morally-in avery restricted circle of their potential
being. We all have reaservoirs of life to draw upon of 
which we do not dream.
